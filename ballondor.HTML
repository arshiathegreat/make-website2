                <h2>What is ballon d'or?</h2>
                <p class="p1">The Ballon d'Or (French pronunciation: [balɔ̃ dɔʁ] ⓘ; lit. 'Golden Ball') is an annual football award presented by French news magazine France Football since 1956. Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with<strong> the FIFA World Player of the Year</strong> (founded in 1991) and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award The Best FIFA Men's Player. The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award organisations. The Ballon d’Or is generally regarded as football’s most prestigious and valuable individual award. Nevertheless, critics have described the award as a "popularity contest", criticising its voting process and for systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.</p>
